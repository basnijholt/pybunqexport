After the some discussion in the lexware Finazmanger forum, it looks like the authors are not interested to integrate bunq into their application (https://forum.lexware.de/threads/37851/)

Also in the bunq forums, no one seemed to have a solution (https://together.bunq.com/d/24026-lexware-quicken-finanzmanager-import-from-bunq)

So I decided to implement a simple csv export with python and the bunq api.
